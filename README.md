The client, The Gaming Room, is seeking to expand their game Draw It or Lose It, originally developed for Android, into a web-based version. The goal is to support multiple teams and players, with unique identifiers for each game, team, and player to avoid conflicts. The game must run on multiple platforms and maintain a seamless experience across browsers and devices, with only one instance of the game allowed in memory at any given time.
I believe I did well in organizing the requirements clearly and ensuring that each step, from game and team management to system constraints, was well-documented. The use of diagrams, like the Domain Model, helped visualize the relationships between classes and how the system components would interact, making it easier to translate into code.
The process of working through the design document was extremely helpful in that it forced me to think about potential issues before starting development. For instance, understanding how the Singleton pattern would ensure only one game instance is active at a time helped guide the coding of the game's core functionality.
If I could revise one part of my work, I'd improve the security section. Although it mentions user authentication and data encryption, I'd include more details about how user data will be managed across different platforms and what specific security measures (like token-based authentication or OAuth) will be implemented to ensure safety and privacy.I interpreted the user's needs by focusing on maintaining a consistent gaming experience across multiple platforms. I prioritized user identifiers to prevent conflicts and enhance usability. Understanding these needs was critical because if the software didn't meet the user's expectations, the game wouldn't succeed in its new, broader environment.
I approached designing the software by first breaking down the user stories and translating them into functional requirements. In the future, I plan to use Agile processes, specifically focusing on iterative development and continuous user feedback, to ensure the final product aligns closely with user needs and provides a seamless experience across platforms.
